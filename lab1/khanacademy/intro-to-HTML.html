  <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
  Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
  There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
  And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
  Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
  Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
  Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
  Until one day, you walk.<br>
  One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
  Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
  Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
  This. is. learning.<br>
  It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
  You just don’t get it, yet.
  Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
  are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
  Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
</p>
<p>
  You only have to know one thing:<br>
  You can learn anything.
